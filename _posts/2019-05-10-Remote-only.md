If you've followed along with my blog you may have noticed that I had my first go at remote only work back in 2014-2016. 

The freedom created by this was Wonderful. But a few questions remained unanswered. Notably how sell with no phyical contact

And customers reacted more positively to this than I first imagined. But I had a mixed bag of project work including support and systems administration contracts. 

## Fast forward to 2019
I've been involved with a larger project outside my primary coding focus to keep cash flow going in a transition. 

I love diverse things but I've come through the latest project with a sense that it  creates conflicting needs in my day. Mostly the need for me to be avalable on call has been detrimental to development.

A primary issue has been high interruption levels. And so today I've set in motion a plan to shield development times and get deep work done. 

I've also finally decided that no matter what I need to move into development as a primary role. So going forward all other projects are getting canned. It's a transition but one I'm looking forward to finally making.

After having a good at go at filling in any CSS blanks I'm ready to dig deeper into Full Stack JS.
