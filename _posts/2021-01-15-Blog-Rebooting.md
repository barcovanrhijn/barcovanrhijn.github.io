I've been keeping notes of projects for some time. And have meant to publish this for the benefits of others to learn from some of the experiences I've had. And to share some of my though process.

So Here goes....

## Github, Meet Jekyl
To get a Github pages site up you need to start a repo with your username.githubpages.com. You'll find the the [ getting started with github pages ](https://pages.github.com/).

## Can you say Jekyll?
This site is based of Jekyl which is a Jamstack site framework built with Ruby on Rails. It's Github's reccomended default although you can use things like Hugo or others. I like the simplicity of Jekyll which allows for maximum design expression with little fuss. 

Jekyl speaks HTML, Markdown, JSON and more. It's a fantastic way to get technical content up if you don't need a backend. 

## Where do I put images in Jekyll
Under the main Assets folder. The _site folder is generated on build in Jekyll.

## Adding classes in Jekyll Markdown

Just add your classes like this
``{: .rounded .image}``

``![alt text](logo.png "Title")``

This will render out the image tag with the classes you specified.

## Ready Set Lauch
Write, Build, Git Push and we're off to a beautiful friendship.
