I've been keeping notes of projects for some time. And have meant to publish this for the benefits of others to learn from some of the experiences I've had. 

So Here goes....

## Github, Meet Jekyl
To get a Github pages site up you need to start a repo with your username.githubpages.com. You'll find the the [ getting started with github pages ](https://pages.github.com/).

## Can you say Jekyll?
This is is based of Jekyl which is a Jamstack site framework built with Ruby on Rails. It's Github's reccomended default although you can use things like Hugo or others. I like the simplicity of Jekyll which allows for maximum design expression with little fuss. 

## Where do I put images
Images for the assets
