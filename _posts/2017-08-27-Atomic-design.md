I’ve recently enjoyed learning about Atomic design. It’s really broadened my thinking in terms of how I plan out design. 

Some of the smaller projects like themes for Wordpress sites of small Businesses don’t really have the budget to invest in design systems. 

I think as time goes on more businesses will start to think this way. But right now Small business is stuck in the design, neglect, abandon and redesign cycle. 
This really alienates end users who really resent having to re-learn how to use a site they love.

My take-away from this is moving consistently and incrementally in a design. And thinking in layers

And I'm looking forward to taking on larger projects that have room for the gains caused by getting everything consistent.

If you've not come across [Brad Frost's Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) you should really read it! It's a wonderful way to think of design as components.
