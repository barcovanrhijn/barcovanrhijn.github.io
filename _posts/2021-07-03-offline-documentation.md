So I know we can Google documentation for just about anything. But I often find I use way more clicks than I need to find the exact version of documentation I'm looking for. 

Using ZealDocs is a great time-saver instead of having to look up documentation for things like HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, JS and more.

The added bonus is that you have documentation to continue coding if your Internet connection goes down. 

Another technique has been to reference documentation from the IDE. I've used Jetbrains IDEs extensively for simple reference as I type.

But every, so often I'm looking for full reference and zeal is just perfect for that.
