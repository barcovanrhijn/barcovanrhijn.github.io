I've been looking at ways to track overall time spent coding and dig deeper into where I spend time. 

As a Freelancer I track time for projects short and long term but often feel that I want to get an overview. Especially when I'm working a few short term projects along side my longer term project work.

I discovered WakaTime which is a great way of setting code goals to ensure that I spend more time coding. It helps me see when customer communication starts being too big a part of my work day. 

Using WakaTime has allowed me to set Coding goals 

And it gives an interesting graph that shows what languages dominated your coding day.

Overall it's good fun and highly reccomended.
