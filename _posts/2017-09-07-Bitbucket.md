Been looking at version control for some time. I’ve been doing small code and CSS fixes to sites for a few months. Built out simple Wordpress plugins. 

It has generally felt like learning to push such code to a Git repo would take more effort than reward. But after I’ve looked at other version control systems out there. 

I’ve decided that Git is a clear winner in terms of enabling team work. Team work was the bit that really got me interested in Git in the end.

## the Intern

Recently had a Grad Student make contact for Internship. He’s a friend of a friend which made for a nice warm introduction. He’s about to finish his degree but has gotten stuck in the Job readiness department. 

I’ve been looking at ways for us to collaborate remotely when we can’t work in person.

I ended up going with 
- Asana
- Bitbucket 
- Slack 
as our remote work stack. And we’ve just heading into a new project together.

We’ve taken quite some time going over Wordpress themes and setup for Web design. 

Also moved my Development environment over to Ubuntu from Windows7 after dabbling in Windows8 then 8.1 then 10.

After careful consideration I actually enjoy using Bitbucket it’s got more functionality and is more integrated with Atlassian’s Development tool-set. 

It’s been fairly easy to onboard an Intern. All it took was writing some walk-throughs and links to relevant docs and we’re all set. Shared this on our Wiki, and everyone was on the same page quickly.

Will be re-looking Github again in the future.
