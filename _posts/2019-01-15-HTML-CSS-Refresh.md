I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp as a refresher for Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web like W3Schools while building customer and internal projects. 
But there has never been a way for me to Showcase what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. 

I know much of this will be a review, but I've seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. 

So after first helping an intern with Front End design back in 2017 I've opened up a lot things I'd like to explore in Front End design. So I'm eager to jump in and get started.
