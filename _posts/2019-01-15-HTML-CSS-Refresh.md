## Refreshing and documenting my HTML & CSS3 skills
I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp to fill out any gaps in my Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web like W3Schools while building customer and internal projects. 

But there has never been a way for me to Shocase what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. 

I know much of this will be a review, but I've seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. 

So after first helping an intern with Front End design back in 2017 I've opened up a lot things I'd like to explore in Front End design. So I'm eager to jump in and get started.
