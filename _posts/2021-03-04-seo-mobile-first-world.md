## Mobile Performance affects rankings

It's official! Since Jan 2020 Google now considers the mobile view of your page as a large factor to your SEO score.

This is hardly surprising since so many users browse the web from their phones. 

### Recent case study

On a recent e-Commerce project the statistic was close to 90% of visitors. 

### Conversion still a challenge

Obviously this is hard to ignore although conversion on mobile is an interesting thing to consider with such limited screen space. 

And the fact that mobile only users are often only slightly Digitally literate.

All people muddle their way through the web but when it comes to Mobile users they are the ultimate muddlers from my observation.

### Conclusion

So as of 2021 if you're site performs poorly on mobile it will start affecting your rankings negatively. 

It's clearly time to rethink & rework out Apps and Sites. While we at it a good dose of UX wouldn't hurt SEO or users either.

Just my two cents...
