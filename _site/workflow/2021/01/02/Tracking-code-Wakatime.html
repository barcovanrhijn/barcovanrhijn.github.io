    <h1>Developer Analytics in Wakatime</h1>
<p>02 Jan 2021 - Barco van Rhijn</p>

<p>I’ve been looking at ways to track overall time spent coding and dig deeper into where I spend time.</p>

<h2 id="task-tracking-is-not-always-enough">Task tracking is not always enough</h2>
<p>As a Freelancer I track time for projects short and long term but often feel that I want to get an overview. Especially when I’m working a few short term projects along side my longer term project work.</p>

<h2 id="meet-wakatime">Meet WakaTime</h2>
<p>I discovered WakaTime which is a great way of setting code goals to ensure that I spend more time coding. It helps me see when customer communication starts being too big a part of my work day. Since it intergrates directly into my IDE it’s a great fit.</p>

<h3 id="coding-goals">Coding goals</h3>
<p>Using WakaTime has allowed me to set Coding goals</p>

<h3 id="understand-what-you-code">Understand what you code</h3>
<p>And it gives an interesting graph that shows what languages dominated your coding day.</p>

<h4 id="heres-an-example-of-how-my-coding-time-was-split-today-youll-notice-other-here-which-was-spent-building-out-an-email-signature-for-a-client">Here’s an example of how my coding time was split today. You’ll notice other here which was spent building out an email signature for a client.</h4>

<h3 id="much-more">Much more</h3>
<p>Waka time has much to offer and is a great way to monitor lots of coding metrics.</p>

<p>Overall it’s good fun and highly reccomended.</p>
