    <h1>Booting up my personal Blog</h1>
<p>15 Jan 2021 - Barco van Rhijn</p>

<p>I’ve been keeping notes of projects for some time. And have meant to publish this for the benefits of others to learn from some of the experiences I’ve had.</p>

<p>So Here goes….</p>

<h2 id="github-meet-jekyl">Github, Meet Jekyl</h2>
<p>To get a Github pages site up you need to start a repo with your username.githubpages.com. You’ll find the the <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> getting started with github pages </a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-say-jekyll">Can you say Jekyll?</h2>
<p>This is is based of Jekyl which is a Jamstack site framework built with Ruby on Rails. It’s Github’s reccomended default although you can use things like Hugo or others. I like the simplicity of Jekyll which allows for maximum design expression with little fuss.</p>

<p>Images for the assets</p>
