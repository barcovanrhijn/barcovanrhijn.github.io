    <h1>Hello Ruby</h1>
<p>18 Dec 2020 - Barco van Rhijn</p>

<p>I’ve been hearing about Ruby for some years. But I’ve been sceptical about the amount of moving parts (Magic) that are introduced by Ruby in the process of development. So this year I decided to test it out for myself in the holidays.</p>

<p>In 2020  I’ve built out a small Project in Laravel that handles Reseller packages and Pricing for B2B it feels familiar coming from the Javascript side of things. I also disovered that Laravel sort of combines ideas from JS and Ruby.</p>

<p>One of the Developers I follow online mentioned what they’ve been doing on Ruby and I was intrigued to take a look. Well I spent a today and learned the basics.</p>

<p>So far I like that Ruby is similar in it’s abillity to scaffold various parts of an application. After learning how that works it no longer seems like a Ruby Project can spin out of control.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-like">What I like</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I like how easy CRUD is with Ruby - feels like Laravel.</li>
  <li>The stack feels less fragmented than JS stacks do.</li>
  <li>The language so far seems enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-may-have-to-learn-to-love">What I may have to learn to love</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Deployement of Ruby projects seem to be a bit more complicated than PHP but not so much more complicated than Node.js apps. I manage several VPS’ running production code. So It’s not insurmountable to deploy.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Intalling a Ruby Development environment
Learned that this part of Ruby on Windows can be tricky and how to get it done.</li>
  <li>Ruby MVC and Project structure
The Ruby project Structure is remarkably easy to understand coming from Laravel</li>
  <li>Routing with Ruby
Routing uses</li>
  <li>Variables in Ruby
Ruby variables are just words like in Bash unless you want to increase their scope. Variables passed from controller to page are written @variable</li>
  <li>Finding and Using Gems</li>
  <li>Defining production vs development gems</li>
  <li>Controllers in Ruby
Controllers are</li>
  <li>Migrations and Databases in Ruby</li>
  <li>Production v.s. Development configs</li>
  <li>Creating CRUD forms in Ruby</li>
  <li>Add custom styling to Ruby elements</li>
  <li>Use Devise to create login and profile pages</li>
  <li>Database Associations</li>
  <li>Controllers beyond basic Crud</li>
  <li>Deploying Ruby code to git and Heroku</li>
</ul>

<p>Planning to build out a first project over Tomorrow.</p>
