This is my personal blog where I share things that I'm thinking about.

      <p>I discovered recently that Ionic have made VueJs quite a priority on their development line-up. And since I’ve got a new project lined up I decided to dig in and see what they’ve got.</p>

      <h2><a href="/ruby/2020/12/18/hello-Ruby.html">Hello Ruby</a></h2>
      <p>I’ve been hearing about Ruby for some years. But I’ve been sceptical about the amount of moving parts (Magic) that are introduced by Ruby in the process of development. So this year I decided to test it out for myself in the holidays.</p>

<p>I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp to fill out any gaps in my Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web while building customer and internal projects. But there has never been a way for me to Shocase what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. I know much of this will be a review, but I’ve seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. My first day has been a great review on some things I know well.</p>

      <p>Been looking at version control for some time. I’ve been doing small code and CSS fixes to sites for a few months. Built out simple Wordpress plugins.
It has generally felt like learning to push such code to a Git repo would take more effort than reward. But after I’ve looked at other version control systems out there. I’ve decided that Git is a clear winner in terms of enabling team work. Team work was the bit that really got me interested in Git in the end.</p>
