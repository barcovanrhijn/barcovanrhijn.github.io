      <p>I’ve been hearing about Ruby for some years. But I’ve been sceptical about the amount of moving parts that are introduced by Ruby in the process of development.</p>

      <p>It’s day two of my HTML challenge. I’m feeling great. I’m completing this challenge during the evenings after work.</p>

<p>I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp to fill out any gaps in my Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web while building customer and internal projects. But there has never been a way for me to Shocase what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. I know much of this will be a review, but I’ve seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. My first day has been a great review on some things I know well.</p>
