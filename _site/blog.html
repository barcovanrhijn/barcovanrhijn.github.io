            <p>If you work with any technology long enough you get to see some quirks. 
In the recent couple of months I’ve started seeing something that I can only term Github Amnesia.</p>

            <p>A normal ORM call in Tina4PHP includes a where function which is similar to what you may see in Laravel. However, the syntax more closely matches SQL. But once you have a lot of where conditions this becomes quite a long unwieldy line.</p>

            <p>There’s been a growing trend towards Front-end JS frameworks in the past years. I think these frameworks have their uses. 
But I don’t think Frameworks like React, Vue and Angular always make sense for every project. For me it all comes down to simplicity and getting work out the door close to budget.</p>

            <p>A number of years have passed since I first saw the <a href="https://tina4.com/documentation">Tina4</a> stack. Tina4 officially strives not to be a framework. So rather call a collection of best practices for PHP but soon other languages as well.</p>

            <p>I discovered recently that Ionic have made VueJs quite a priority on their development line-up. And since I’ve got a new project lined up I decided to dig in and see what they’ve got.</p>
