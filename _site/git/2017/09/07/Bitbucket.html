<p><p>Been looking at version control for some time. I’ve been doing small code and CSS fixes to sites for a few months. Built out simple Wordpress plugins.</p>

<p>It has generally felt like learning to push such code to a Git repo would take more effort than reward. But after I’ve looked at other version control systems out there like SVN I decided that Git is a clear winner in terms of enabling team work. 
Team work was the bit that really got me interested in Git in the end.</p>

<h2 id="the-intern">the Intern</h2>

<p>Recently had a Grad Student make contact for Internship. He’s a friend of a friend which made for a nice warm introduction. He’s about to finish his degree but has gotten stuck in the Job readiness department.</p>

<p>I’ve been looking at ways for us to collaborate remotely when we can’t work in person.</p>

<p>I ended up going with</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asana</li>
  <li>Bitbucket</li>
  <li>Slack 
as our remote work stack. And we’ve just heading into a new project together.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve taken quite some time going over Wordpress themes and setup for Web design.</p>

<p>Also moved my Development environment over to Ubuntu from Windows7 after dabbling in Windows8 then 8.1 then 10.</p>

<p>After careful consideration I actually enjoy using Bitbucket it’s got more functionality and is more integrated with Atlassian’s Development tool-set.</p>

<p>It’s been fairly easy to onboard an Intern. All it took was writing some walk-throughs and links to relevant docs and we’re all set. Shared this on our Wiki, and everyone was on the same page quickly.</p>

<p>Will be re-looking Github again in the future.</p>
