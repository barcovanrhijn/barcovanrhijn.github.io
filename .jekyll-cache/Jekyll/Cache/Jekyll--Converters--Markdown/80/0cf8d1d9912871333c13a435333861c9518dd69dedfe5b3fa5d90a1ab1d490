I"h	<p>I’ve been hearing about Ruby for some years. But I’ve been sceptical about the amount of moving parts that are introduced by Ruby in the process of development.</p>

<p>But this year I’ve built out a small Project in Laravel that handles Reseller packages and Pricing for B2B it feels familiar coming from the Javascript side of things. I also disovered that Laravel sort of combines ideas from JS and Ruby.</p>

<p>One of the Developers I follow online mentioned what they’ve been doing on Ruby and I was intrigued to take a look. Well I spent a today and learned the basics.</p>

<p>So far I like that Ruby is similar in it’s abillity to scaffold various parts of an application. After learning how that works it no longer seems like a Ruby Project can spin out of control.</p>

<h1 id="what-i-like">What I like</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I like how easy CRUD is with Ruby - feels like Laravel.</li>
  <li>The stack feels less fragmented than JS stacks do.</li>
  <li>The language so far seems enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-may-have-to-learn-to-love">What I may have to learn to love</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Deployement of Ruby projects seem to be a bit more complicated than PHP but not so much more complicated than Node.js apps. I manage several VPS’ running production code. So It’s not insurmountable.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Intalling a Ruby Development environment
Learned that this part of Ruby on Windows can be tricky and how to get it done.</li>
  <li>Ruby MVC and Project structure
The Ruby project Structure is remarkably easy to understand coming from Laravel</li>
  <li>Routing with Ruby
Routing uses</li>
  <li>Variables in Ruby
Ruby variables are just words like in Bash unless you want to increase their scope. Variables passed from controller to page are written @variable</li>
  <li>Finding and Using Gems</li>
  <li>Defining production vs development gems</li>
  <li>Controllers in Ruby
Controllers are</li>
  <li>Migrations and Databases in Ruby</li>
  <li>Production v.s. Development configs</li>
  <li>Creating CRUD forms in Ruby</li>
  <li>Add custom styling to Ruby elements</li>
  <li>Use Devise to create login and profile pages</li>
  <li>Database Associations</li>
  <li>Controllers beyond basic Crud</li>
  <li>Deploying Ruby code to git and Heroku</li>
</ul>

<p>Planning to build out a first project over the Tomorrow.</p>
