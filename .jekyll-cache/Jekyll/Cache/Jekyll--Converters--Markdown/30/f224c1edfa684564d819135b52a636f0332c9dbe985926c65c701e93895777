<p>I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp to fill out any gaps in my Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web while building customer and internal projects. But there has never been a way for me to Shocase what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. I know much of this will be a review, but Iâ€™ve seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. My first day has been a great review on some things I know well.</p>
