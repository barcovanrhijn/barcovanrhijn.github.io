I"p<p>I decided to sign up for FreeCodeCamp to fill out any gaps in my Front End design skills. Been using several resources around the web while building customer and internal projects. But there has never been a way for me to prove what I know. Plus I think it may be high time I run through everything from top to bottom. I know much of this will be a review, but I’ve seen how learning, then sharing deepens knowledge. My first day has been a great review on some things I know well.</p>

<p>##What I learned today:</p>

<h1 id="html-headings">HTML Headings</h1>
<p>Something familiar how to place different heading tags. Good structure is essential to any website. Sizing needs to create flow that’s easy to skim read. This is what most of us do on the web. From a design perspective there are several approaches to this. Using good Typography and Text sizing together helps retain interest. Plus it makes it a whole lot easier to find what you’re looking for. Using H1 and H2 tags carefully is important to the on page SEO of a site if you’re also laying out the content. It’s one reason why I like seperating design and content. Makes the whole process a lot easier.</p>

<h1 id="inform-with-the-paragraph-element">Inform with the Paragraph Element</h1>
<p>Paragraph tags are great to seperate text.</p>

<h1 id="fill-in-the-blank-with-placeholder-text">Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text</h1>
<p>Pig latin works a treat for filling out paragraphs to give a sense of how a design will flow once it has actual content. The Kitty pig latin was very cute. Text is placed between the tags naturally.</p>

<h1 id="comment--uncomment-html">Comment &amp; Uncomment HTML</h1>
<p>What would the world be without comments.</p>

<h1 id="delete-html-elements">Delete HTML Elements</h1>

<h1 id="introduction-to-html5-elements">Introduction to HTML5 Elements</h1>
<p>Add Images to Your Website</p>
