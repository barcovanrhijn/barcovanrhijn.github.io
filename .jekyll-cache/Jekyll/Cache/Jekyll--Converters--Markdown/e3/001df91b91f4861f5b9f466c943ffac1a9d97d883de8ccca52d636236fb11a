I"Ý<p>Been looking at version control for some time. Iâ€™ve been doing small code and CSS fixes to sites for a few months. Built out simple Wordpress plugins.
It has generally felt like learning to push such code to a Git repo would take more effort than reward. But after Iâ€™ve looked at other version control systems out there. Iâ€™ve decided that Git is a clear winner in terms of enabling team work. Team work was the bit that really got me interested in Git in the end.</p>
