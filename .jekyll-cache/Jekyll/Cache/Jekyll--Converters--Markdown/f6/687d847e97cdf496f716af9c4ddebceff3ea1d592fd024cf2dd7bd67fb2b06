I"¤<p>Iâ€™ve been keeping notes of projects for some time. And have meant to publish this for the benefits of others to learn from some of the experiences Iâ€™ve had.</p>

<p>So Here goesâ€¦.</p>

<h2 id="github-meet-jekyl">Github, Meet Jekyl</h2>
<p>To get a Github pages site up you need to start a repo with your username.githubpages.com. Youâ€™ll find the the <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> getting started with github pages </a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-you-say-jekyll">Can you say Jekyll?</h2>
<p>This site is based of Jekyl which is a Jamstack site framework built with Ruby on Rails. Itâ€™s Githubâ€™s reccomended default although you can use things like Hugo or others. I like the simplicity of Jekyll which allows for maximum design expression with little fuss.</p>

<p>Jekyl speaks HTML, Markdown, JSON and more. Itâ€™s a fantastic way to get technical content up if you donâ€™t need a backend.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-put-images-in-jekyll">Where do I put images in Jekyll</h2>
<p>Under the main Assets folder. The _site folder is generated on build in Jekyll.</p>

<h2 id="adding-classes-in-jekyll-markdown">Adding classes in Jekyll Markdown</h2>

<p>Just add your classes like this
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{: .rounded .image}</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">![alt text](logo.png "Title")</code></p>

<p>This will render out the image tag with the classes you specified.</p>
