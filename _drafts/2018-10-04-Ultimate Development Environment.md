# The Ultimate Development Environment

I've been thinking about great Development setups for about 2 Decades. I've gotten very good at getting the most out of the Windows machines I've used. Windows7 has served me well over the years and it's become a nice stable environment for the most part.

So it finally happened this week. After Dabbling in Linux for about 10 years on and off and managing Linux servers for clients for around 6 years I finally found a very compelling reason to only work from Linux.

## Some background

I started out my Career in the early 2000's in a small Software Development startup called P37 Solutions. 

## VB6 Meets Travel Agencies
The company built out software predominantly in Visual Basic 6 and later C# for the Travel Industry to simplify bookings through Amadeus a travel network. 

Amadeus was known to introduce a slew of virus infections into Travel agencies and general machines used to be air gapped from the Amadeus machines. 

## The Virus Colluseum
A Tech back then told me that once a machine hit around 2000-3000 virus infections it actually got more usable because the different virusses where competing for the same resources to the point that none of them had much success. These machines where so Virus Infected that you'd crash windows by even attempting to clear anything up.  I tried as a rookie, it was a pointless endeavour.

## Anything was possible

P37 built out Smaller projects like stock management systems. 

But it was an interesting time in tech. 
- XML was just becoming a standard that would lead to PDF and HTML standards amongs others. 
- CSS1 was in it's infancy. 
- Linux had not been thought up yet. 

## Volunteering

As a volunteer Part of my initial responsibillities in the Office was supporting Senior developers by rebuilding their the Windows 2000 and later XP machines. 

Back then Dev machines would generally only remain reliable for 6-9months. 

Developers where pushing these machines very hard and before XP adding DLL's and installing and removing apps created heaps 
of clutter resulting in early Windows crashes.

## Fast Forward 3 months 

I quickly got hired 3months later and promoted to builing out UI, Debugging and supporting customers (remotely as soon as the first cellular networks landed).

The firm hired a replacement to take care of hardware while I stepped into a software & support role.

Later I'd manage the Windows Servers that ran some of the code we built.

## Back to the Dev Stack

Back then the benchmark I set for rebuilding a Developer machine from Format to deployed was around 4hours. 

This included all the tooling and custom components etc. that devs needed.

This sounds long, but most things where a manual process. Deployment tooling & OS  automation have come a long way since then.

Plug and Play was jokingly referred to as Plug and Pray in the pre Windows7 world.

We're really spoiled in the modern OS by loads of automations we take for granted.

## So why I switched

### Windows 8.1 the new Vista?

With the introduction of Windows 8 looking much like the historic release of Windows Millenium, I was eager to see what 8.1 would bring. 

But sadly 8.1 looked like another Vista release taking effectively double the Ram to boot up that Windows 8 did. 

It was not a great situation since you need every ounce of Ram once you start emulating Android devices. 

### Back to Windows 7 

I moved back to Windows7 it's a nice stable environment that works reliably for several years unless you really maintain it poorly and mess it up.

### Trying out Development on Ubuntu

I'd recently been reading about the Developer experience on Ubuntu. It was time for it to be more than a toy. I moved some of my Front End development to Ubuntu 18.04 and it was going great. 

### Upgrading to Windows 10

Windows 10 rolled around. It was more polished and reminded me of the early days of Windows7. At least it showed potential after it had been around a few months. 

But it had one nagging issue. Forced updates was a mistake from the get go. Non-enterprise users where forced to become gineu pigs. 

Microsoft had been culling it's testing team for some years which has really reduced code quality. 

### The ultimate update wipes my drive

Anyway fast forward to Oct 2018. 

KB4532693 rolled around and I was one of the lucky ones to get my drive wiped. But this update in my case low level formatted the drive good and dropped all partitions.

None of the fixes worked because Windows was lost in that update. Not only that but Windows managed to take my Ubuntu partitions with it Kamakazi style. 

### Windows7 crashes weeks after install

I moved back to Windows7 and somehow that installation was short lived. It's a first experience out of years of Windows installations where I'd seen a double whammy.

## Ubuntu - the start of a beautiful friendship

So this was the start of a beautiful frienship between me and my Ubuntu environment. 

- It's fast and efficient. 
- Updates are small. 
- Redeploying after the crash is a dream. 

I'm up and running from backups with my Bitbucket repo's syncronized and entire development stack reinstalled in about 90min flat. 

And on top of that almost everything a web developer could ever want is native.
