It's day two of my HTML challenge. I'm feeling great. I'm completing this challenge during the evenings after work. 

Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
Create a Set of Checkboxes
Create a Set of Radio Buttons
Use HTML5 to Require a Field
Add a Submit Button to a Form
Create a Form Element
Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field
Create a Text Field
Create an Ordered List
Create a Bulleted Unordered List
# Turn an Image into a Link
Images make great links. Used to do this with buttons on web pages in the days of CSS1. But now days I like CSS Buttons.
# Make Dead Links Using the Hash Symbol
Fab trick I use often to mock up links and navs before I have all the details.
# Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph
Let the Nesting begin. Something I use almost daily when I build out content for a page. It's a staple of well built sites.
