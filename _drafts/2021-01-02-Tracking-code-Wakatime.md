I've been looking at ways to track overall time spent coding and dig deeper into where I spend time. 

## Task tracking is not always enough
As a Freelancer I track time for projects short and long term but often feel that I want to get an overview. Especially when I'm working a few short term projects along side my longer term project work.

## Meet WakaTime
I discovered WakaTime which is a great way of setting code goals to ensure that I spend more time coding. It helps me see when customer communication starts being too big a part of my work day. Since it intergrates directly into my IDE it's a great fit.

### Coding goals
Using WakaTime has allowed me to set Coding goals 

### Understand what you code
And it gives an interesting graph that shows what languages dominated your coding day.

#### Here's an example of how my coding time was split today. You'll notice other here which was spent building out an email signature for a client.

### Much more
Waka time has much to offer and is a great way to monitor lots of coding metrics.

Overall it's good fun and highly recommended.
