#The Brief
The customer Dante Deo wanted to accept bookings on their Guest house site. 

They wanted icons and information on their page that closely mimics Bookings.com.  

The customer is a couple who run the Guest house together.

We setup the contract and scope of work and got the ball rolling.

#Outcome
I designed a beautiful site matching the Architectural style of this guest house. 

#Additional scope
The customer was also after Ads to get this site performing like Bookings.com but the budget to do this would outpace what they spent on Bookings.com at the time.
