#The Brief
The customer Dante Deo wanted to accept bookings on their Guest house site. They wanted icons and information on their page that closely mimics Bookings.com.  The customer is a couple who run the Guest house together.

#Managing expectations
A limited budget was provided. Enough for front end work.

#Additional scope
